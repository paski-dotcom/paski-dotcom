# 👾  Greetings, fellow net-traveler

**handle:** `@paski-dotcom`  
**signal:** pascal (at) elitebrain.ai  
**pronouns:** he / …an open variable—surprise me.

## 🔭 Current obsession
- **Elegant systems, minimal entropy.**  
- Chasing every inflection point in AI that makes code—or companies—simpler, faster, smarter.

## 🧠 Focus areas
| Sphere | Why it matters to me |
|--------|----------------------|
| **AI-augmented leadership** | When the CEO gets a co-pilot, everyone levels up. |
| **Code clarity** |  Readable > clever.  Deterministic > decorative. |
| **Ops minimalism** |  Spend compute on outcomes, not yak-shaving. |

## 🤝 What I’d love to build *with you*
- Decision-support micro-agents for C-suites  
- Serverless architectures that feel *analog* in their simplicity  
- Auto-documenting pipelines where the README writes itself

## 🛠  Stacks I enjoy
`TypeScript` · `Go` · `Python` · `Next.js` · `GCP` · `LLM toolchains`

That sums up my tolerance for paradigm shifts—prove it works, and I’m in.
